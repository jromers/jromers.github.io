<p>I wrote a few articles and How-to guides where I describe the configuration steps to use cloud-native software in an Oracle Linux on-premise deployment. Most of the information is a result of work I did with customers or material I used for workshops or hands-on labs.</p>

<p>All the How-to guides are tested on my demo-infrastructure, they are simple to use and designed to run on a laptop. This is a very convenient setup and a nice way to explore or develop cloud native applications without spending cloud resources. Use the following Oracle Community document to build this infrastructure:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-1022800">Use Vagrant and VirtualBox to setup Oracle Container Services for use with Kubernetes</a>
</ul>

This will be a growing list with How-to guides organized in sub-projects, for now the following guides are available:
