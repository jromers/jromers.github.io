Who am I ?

My name is Jaap Romers and I'm a Solution Engineer at Oracle and based in The Netherlands. In this role I work as a pre-sales engineer with customers in the EMEA region.

As we all know, open source software is the foundation for cloud computing.
Major companies use open-source software to build cloud applications, infrastructure and services at a pace they need to.

Oracle is a big contributor to open-source technology and open-source software and cloud native tooling is my main focus in the job. 

Feel free to reach out to me !
